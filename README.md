# Sticker Sketchpad üé®

**Sticker Sketchpad** is an interactive, web-based application that allows users to unleash their creativity by sketching and placing stickers on a digital canvas. This app leverages the **Command** and **Observer** design patterns to create a dynamic and responsive user experience. Users can draw with various marker thicknesses, apply pre-built or custom stickers, and undo/redo their actions in real-time.

The application offers high-resolution export functionality and includes a modal dialog for exporting options. Users can choose between a transparent or white background for their exported images. Built with modern web technologies, the project demonstrates proficiency in **TypeScript**, **Deno**, **GitHub Actions**, and front-end development using **HTML5 Canvas**.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Canvas Drawing:** Users can draw freehand on a canvas using mouse input.
- **Multiple Markers:** Choose between thin and thick markers, with an adjustable color hue slider.
- **Sticker Selection:** A range of preset stickers (emoji-based), along with an option to create custom stickers.
- **Undo/Redo:** Implemented using the **Command pattern**, allowing users to revert or reapply changes.
- **High-Resolution Export:** Export the canvas as a 1024x1024 PNG image, with an option to select a white or transparent background via a modal dialog.
